Homework:
·         We are going to set you a simple assignment: In Python write a program that picks a random number between 0 and 100. Then it asks you to guess. It tells you if you are too high or too low. When you get it right, it tells you how many turns it took you, and it asks you to start again.
·         We are going to write this program using git. So you will make the program in stages.
·         Work out stages that you could build it, send me your plan, and don’t start building until I approve the plan.
·         Come up with two different versions, how the program might work in two different ways.
·         OK, now getting started with git: Write for me 5-10 git commands you think you might need for this project.
·         Start a git repo on your personal computer. Write a program and save it in stages. Go back to a previous version and make a branch, make difference changes  so you now have two different versions – two different features.
·         Merge the two versions together.
·         Show me.
 
Learn VSCode (Maybe stage 1, maybe stage 2?)

Homework
·         Follow the tutorial https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial and make your own hello world program that runs from vscode

Packages and Virtual environments

Homework
·         What are python packages? Who publishes them and why? How are they useful to you as a professional programmer when you are working on a project?
·         What is the difference between pip command and pipenv command?
·         What is virtualenv? Do we need virtualenv these days? Why not?
·         Search python packages and list for me two that you think are really interesting and could improve the random number game
·         Install the package using pipenv and use it to improve your game

Learn Python
Resources
I recommend looking at the content lists for videos, being willing to jump around. Don’t just blindly watch from start to end. You want a problem you are trying to solve and use the videos to answer your questions.

Homework
·         What is the difference between Python 2 and Python 3? Which should you be using?
·         Come up with a game idea that you want to build in Python. It should be quite simple, maybe harder than the random number guessing game shown above, but not a lot more. It should be an idea that you can make a first version with just command-line text (Python input and print), but later we will make a webpage interface for your game, so something where having a webpage with buttons, dropdown selectors etc would make the game better.

·         Make your game using git. This time we will also publish it on github.
·         Use two pipenv packages to improve your game
·         What are unit tests? Add some unit tests to prove your program is working
 
Learn Flask
Flask is a very easy python package for making interactive websites.
Resources
·         https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flask.html : good introduction tutorial

·         https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/index.htm : good reference guide
 
Homework
·         Start a new git repo, a new virtual environment (pipenv). Make a basic flask install. Now copy your game into it and modify so you can interact with your game via a webbrowser.  (Alisher_Quiz.io)
·         Save regularly with git. Upload final version to github
 
Learn Django (Stage 2)
Django is like Flask’s older brother. It is a little harder to learn, but is a lot more powerful! In my projects we usually use Django unless it is a small task in which case we might use flask.

·         Write some tests to prove it is working
 
Work assignment

For work assignments, we will start you working on webwork tracker and we will pay you. This time will count as real work instead of just education.
I want you do some some improvements on CorpusFrequency app. See what you think can be improved. Make a branch for each improvement you make, then using github make a Pull Request for each, for me to consider and accept.

Learn Vue and Javascript
Vue is a javascript framework. By using Vue you can quickly add very powerful interactive features to a webpage.

Homework
·         Add some fancy vue functionality to your Django pages by writing vue code within the Django template .html files 
 Work assignment
Think about how you can use Vue to improve CorpusFrequency app, write me your ideas
Wait until you get NUXT mastered, and then we will get you to improve it using NUXT.
Learn REST and NUXT (Stage 2?)
Django-REST is used to allow Django to interact via API calls to a completely separate frontend project. We will use NUXT to make a much cleaner and more powerful self-enclosed Vue frontend. We use Cypress to do End-to-End tests on the frontend.
 
Resources


Homework
·         Write for me the steps you take to create a NUXT project from scratch
 
Work assignment
Add Cypress tests to the CorpusFrequency, checking each page works correctly as you add content.
Add a Github action that will automatically run your Cypress test each time you do a git push.
Ask AJ to set up a server for frontend and backend on GCP


Homework questions on Nuxt, rest, cypress
Vue/NUXT homework:
1.   	Make a list of the common Vue HTML tags you see in our code, look up and write a summary of what each does (v-on/@ , v-html, v-bind/: , v-model…)
Write your answer here, or put in a new document - your choice! This will be a good summary that you can review again in the future for yourself. 
2.   	What are the sections that typically go into our <script> section of a page? (e.g. mounted, data, computed, watch, methods etc) – write a summary of what each does and when to use each one
3.   	How can you debug Vue code from within chrome browser? (install Vue devtools, and also read https://github.com/talkingtoaj/GFGD_frontend/wiki/Vue-devtools-chrome-extension)
4.   	Explain what the vuex store is. Why and when do we use it?
5.   	Javascript: How do you emit events and how do you listen for events in Javascript? How are events useful?
6.   	What is async in javascript? What is the difference between the normal sync and async, when and why do we want to use async? When can we use javascript await command, and when will it create an error? If we do not use await, what value do we get from an async function (a promise – explain what a javascript promise is) and why is it less useful than using await?
7.   	API calls: How do we make API calls to the backend? What is axios?
8.   	What is the use of the following files? package.json , nuxt.config.js
9.   	There are several directories in NUXT for different elements of a NUXT project. Explain the purpose of each of the following: pages, assets, plugins, components, layouts, middleware, store
10.   Explain components in more depth:
a.   	explain props,
b.  	explain how components and pages are similar, how they differ
c.   	explain the use of $emit in components
d.  	explain the use of <slot />
11.   Explain store in more depth:
a.   	getters, mutations, actions – what is the difference between each, when should we use each one?
b.  	How can pages and components access the store? (explain mapGetters and mapActions)
12.   Explain when we use layouts, when we use pages, and when we use components. These three are a little similar, but each was designed with a particular ideal situation in mind.
13.   Routing: explain how URLs are formed from the page directory structure. How does _id.vue and index.vue affect the URLs?
 
Cypress homework
1.   	What is the use of writing cypress tests? (https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell)
2.   	Read the ‘Core concepts’ https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress.html
3.   	How can you tell if they pass from github?
4.   	How can you debug failing cypress tests on your own computer? Do you need to start django also?
