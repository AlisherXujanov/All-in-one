# Introduction 

## What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering and generating static websites. It is built on top of React and provides a more comprehensive solution for building web applications.


## Why is Next.js Better Than React?

1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG):

    - Next.js: Supports SSR and SSG out of the box, which can improve performance and SEO.
    - React: Requires additional libraries or custom setup to achieve SSR and SSG.

2. File-Based Routing:
    - Next.js: Uses a file-based routing system, making it easier to manage routes.
    - React: Requires a third-party library like React Router for routing.

3. API Routes:
    - Next.js: Allows you to create API endpoints within the same project.
    - React: Requires a separate backend setup for API endpoints.

4. Built-In CSS and Sass Support:
    - Next.js: Provides built-in support for CSS and Sass, including CSS modules.
    - React: Requires additional configuration or libraries for CSS and Sass support.

5. Image Optimization:
    - Next.js: Comes with an Image component that optimizes images automatically.
    - React: Requires third-party libraries or custom solutions for image optimization.

6. Automatic Code Splitting:
    - Next.js: Automatically splits code into smaller chunks for better performance.
    - React: Requires manual code splitting or additional tools for optimization.

7. TypeScript Support:
    - Next.js: Supports TypeScript out of the box, making it easier to use in projects.
    - React: Requires additional setup and configuration for TypeScript support.

8. Built-In Analytics:
    - Next.js: Provides built-in support for analytics tools like Google Analytics.
    - React: Requires additional setup or libraries for analytics integration.

Google analytics is needed for tracking the user's behavior on the website. It helps to analyze the user's interaction with the website and provides insights for improving the user experience. In other words, it helps to understand how users navigate through the website, which pages they visit, and how they interact with the content. Any, by knowing this information, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize the website and improve the user experience. Ex: You can identify popular pages, high bounce rates, and user flow patterns to make informed decisions about content, design, and functionality. In UZB, for example, UZUM website uses Google Analytics to track which products are most interesting for you and suggest you related products.
