# Routing

- Next.js uses file-based routing.
- For example, if you create a file called `about.jsx` inside the `pages` directory, you can access it at `localhost:3000/about`.
- If you create a file called `page.jsx` inside the `blogs` directory, you can access it at `localhost:3000/blogs`. (in react.js it is similar to have index.jsx file inside the blogs directory but this time it is called page.jsx)




### Dynamic Routing
- If you create a folder `blogs` and inside blogs another folder called `[blogID]` and inside this folder a file called `page.jsx`, you can access it at `localhost:3000/blogs/1`, `localhost:3000/blogs/2`, etc.
- Or, if you create a file called `[id].jsx` inside the `blogs` directory, you can access it at `localhost:3000/blogs/1`, `localhost:3000/blogs/2`, etc.
- You can access the `id` in the file using `useRouter` hook.
```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
const Blog = () => {
    const router = useRouter();
    const { id } = router.query;
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Blog {id}</h1>
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Custom 404 Page
- To create a custom 404 page, create a file called `not-found.jsx` inside the `pages` directory.

#### Not found function
- We also have a `notFound` function in the `next/navigation` package. We can use it to redirect to the 404 page.
- By using this function, we can redirect to different 404 pages for different routes.
```jsx
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

export default function Posts({ params }) {
    if (params.id > 1000) {
        return notFound();
    }
    return (
        ...
    );
}
```
And we should have `not-found.jsx` file in the same level as the `posts.jsx` file.
