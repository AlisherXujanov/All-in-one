## ðŸŽ¨ Usage

#### Utility-First Approach
Tailwind CSS provides utility classes that you can apply directly to your HTML elements. This approach allows you to build custom designs quickly and efficiently.

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```

#### Responsive Design

Tailwind makes it easy to create responsive designs with its built-in responsive utilities.

**Example: Responsive Grid** <br>
```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">1</div>
  <div class="bg-green-500 p-4">2</div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">3</div>
  <div class="bg-yellow-500 p-4">4</div>
</div>
```

#### Customizing Tailwind
Tailwind is highly customizable. You can extend the default configuration to match your design needs.

**Example: Custom Colors** <br>

`In your tailwind.config.js:`
```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#1a202c',
        secondary: '#2d3748',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Use your custom colors in your HTML:
```html
<div class="bg-primary text-secondary p-4">
  Custom Colors
</div>
```
