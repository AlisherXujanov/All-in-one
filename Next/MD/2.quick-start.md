### There are 2 types of components in Next.js:
1. `Server components`  
    - In next.js all components are server components by default.
    - They have ability to run tasks like reading files, fetching data, etc.
    - However, they are not able use Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

2. `Client components`
    - These components can use Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc. But, we need to add `use client` at the top of the file.
    - Client components are not able to run tasks like reading files, fetching data, etc.


# File Structure
- `pages` directory is the most important directory in Next.js. It contains all the pages of the application.
- `components` directory contains all the components of the application.
