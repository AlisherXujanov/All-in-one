# META Tags

### UTF stands for Unicode Transformation Format.

1. Text Encoding: Computers store text as numbers. 
    Text encoding is like a secret code that tells the computer 
    how to turn those numbers back into readable text.

2. UTF-8: This is one of the most popular text encodings. 
    It can represent every character in the world, from English letters 
    to Chinese characters, emojis, and more.

3. Why Use UTF-8?:
    - Universal: It can handle any character from any language.
    - Compatibility: Most websites and software understand UTF-8.
    - Efficiency: It uses less space for common characters (like English letters) 
        and more space for rare ones.

4.  In HTML: When you tell the browser to use UTF-8, it knows how to 
    correctly display all the characters on your webpage.

5. How to Set UTF-8 in HTML:
    - Use the `<meta>` tag with the `charset` attribute.
    - Set the `charset` attribute to `UTF-8`.

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```

So, using UTF-8 ensures that everyone, no matter what language they speak, can see the text on your webpage correctly.
